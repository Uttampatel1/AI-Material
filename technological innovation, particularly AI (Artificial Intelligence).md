The video uses **surfing as a metaphor** for understanding and navigating **technological innovation**, particularly **AI (Artificial Intelligence)**. It explains how technology evolves in **waves**, how organizations can adapt to these waves, and what **lessons surfing** offers for dealing with rapid change.

### 🌊 Part 1: The Waves of Innovation

#### Joseph Schumpeter’s Idea (1942)

* Economist **Joseph Schumpeter** described **“waves of disruption”** — cycles of innovation that transform society and business.
* These have now been extended to **six major technology waves**.

#### The Six Waves of Technology

1. **1st Wave – Industrial Revolution (~1780s)**

   * Machines + waterpower → faster production vs. handcrafted goods.
2. **2nd & 3rd Waves – Transportation & Power (1800s–1900s)**

   * Steam power, trains, electricity → faster manufacturing + distribution.
3. **4th Wave – Electronics & Computers (Mid-1900s)**

   * Airplanes, electronics, computing → faster information access.
4. **5th Wave – Internet (1990–2016)**

   * Connectivity, software, and communication explosion.
   * From 2.3M connected people (1990) → 3.4B (2016).
5. **6th Wave – Artificial Intelligence (2020–present)**

   * We’re in this now — AI is transforming how we work and think.

### 🤖 Part 2: The Waves of AI

AI itself has **its own smaller waves**, each representing a leap in capability.

1. **Birth of AI (1950s)**

   * Alan Turing proposes machine intelligence → early optimism, then **AI winter**.
2. **Machine Learning Revival (1990s)**

   * IBM **Deep Blue (1996)** beats Kasparov → AI learns from data.
3. **Modern Deep Learning (2010s)**

   * Voice assistants like **Alexa** and **Siri** → AI responds naturally.
4. **AI Surge (2020s)**

   * A “tsunami” of AI technologies, subdivided into **4 mini-waves**:

     * **1️⃣ Pattern Recognition** – AI finds trends in data.
     * **2️⃣ Chat AI (LLMs)** – Conversational systems (ChatGPT, RAG, etc.).
     * **3️⃣ Agentic AI** – Agents that can *do* things autonomously.
     * **4️⃣ Physical AI** – Robots and embodied systems we interact with.

This surge brings tools like **Copilot**, **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and more — forming an **ecosystem** of AI technologies.

### 🏄 Part 3: Challenges in Adopting AI (The Surfing Analogy)

The speaker compares **adopting AI** to **learning how to surf**:

| AI Adoption Challenge               | Surfing Analogy                                            |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣ **Where to start?**             | Which beach or break to surf at?                           |
| 2️⃣ **Which tech to use?**          | What board or wetsuit to use?                              |
| 3️⃣ **Is my data ready?**           | Is my gear waxed and fins set up?                          |
| 4️⃣ **Do I have the right skills?** | Am I skilled for big or small waves?                       |
| 5️⃣ **Is the timing right?**        | Are tides, winds, and waves favorable?                     |
| 6️⃣ **Organizational resistance**   | Is the break friendly or local-only? (Cultural resistance) |

### 🧭 Part 4: Lessons from Surfing for Adopting AI

1. **Know your goal (What are you trying to do?)**

   * Focus on outcomes, not just “doing AI.”
   * Just like deciding what type of surf you want.

2. **Be ready**

   * Have the right tech, skills, and setup.
   * Readiness > brute force.

3. **Look ahead**

   * Don’t jump on the first wave.
   * Anticipate future trends and prepare strategically.

4. **Be patient**

   * Wait for the right opportunity — don’t rush adoption.

5. **Seize the opportunity**

   * When ready, act decisively and embrace change.
   * “Go big or go home.”

6. **Adapt constantly**

   * Every wave (and every tech) is different — adjust continuously.

7. **Learn from failure**

   * Falling is part of surfing — same with innovation.
   * Reflect, adapt, and try again.

8. **Cheer others on**

   * Celebrate team and industry successes.
   * Collaboration and encouragement strengthen progress.
